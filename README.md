# Java Code Vault (ft. Coffee) ☕

Behold my collection of Java code that got me through countless assignments and projects! 

Each snippet has survived the trial by fire of tight deadlines and midnight debugging sessions. Not claiming they're revolutionary, but they've earned their place in this vault.

## What's Inside

### Basic Operations ➕
`Addition`, `Calculator`, `Minmax`, `Number of Even and Odd numbers`, `Summation`, `Total and highest marks`

Everything you need for handling numbers and basic calculations. From simple addition to finding max values and summing arrays.

### Object-Oriented Programming 🧩
`Area Constructor Overload`, `Area Method Overloading`, `Employee Data Storing`, `Inheritance`, `Highest Wage`

These demonstrate core OOP concepts with real examples - from method overloading to inheritance hierarchies that actually make sense.

### Data Processing 📊
`Tables`, `Sum of diagonal elements`, `Transpose of Matrix`, `Palindrome`

Matrix operations and data validations that will save you hours of frustration.

### Exception Handling 🛠️
`In-built Exceptions`, `User-defined Exception`, `Payment Exception (User-defined)`

Custom exception classes and handling techniques that make your programs robust.

### Validation & Utilities 🔍
`Eligibility`, `Password validity`

Input validation logic that helps build safer applications.

### Multithreading 🧵
`Multithreading (by implementing Runnable)`, `Multithreading (using thread class)`

Two approaches to multithreading with clear examples of when to use each one.

### GUI Development 🖥️
`Registration Form (GUI based)`

Swing-based interface example with proper event handling.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These solutions were written at a college level - they solve specific problems but aren't necessarily optimized for performance or scalability. They worked for my assignments, but real-world applications might need more robustness!

## 🚀 Running the Code

Compile a Java file:
```
javac FileName.java
```

Run a Java program:
```
java ClassName
```
